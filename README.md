InstallAware© APPX Library for Microsoft's Desktop Bridge

InstallAware is the only vendor giving developers a free ride across Microsoft’s Desktop Bridge to the Universal Windows Platform highway. Use InstallAware's free and open source APPX Builder Library, together with the free and open source single-step command line converter, to compile any pre-existing Win32, Win64, or .NET application as a modern Universal Windows Platform app. The source code for the DLL and the quick command line converter are both published under the GNU AGPLv3, helping any open source installer such as Inno and NSIS, and partially open source installer such as Windows Installer XML (WiX lacks open source or free APPX support), bridge the setups they create to the Universal Windows Platform via Microsoft®’s Desktop Bridge.

Requirement;
- Microsoft Visual Studio 2015
- Windows 10 SDK
