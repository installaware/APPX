# APPX
InstallAware© APPX Library for Microsoft's Desktop Bridge

InstallAware chose the GNU AGPLv3 license to open source its APPX builder DLL, helping any open source installer such as Inno and NSIS, and partially open source installer such as Windows Installer XML (WiX lacks open source or free APPX support), bridge the setups they create to the Universal Windows Platform via Microsoft®’s Desktop Bridge.

Requirement;
- Microsoft Visual Studio 2015
- Windows 10 SDK
